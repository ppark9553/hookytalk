### HookyTalk Naming Conventions:



- Normally in Java/Android development, methods/functions follow the "lowerCamelCase()" convention, and variables, also, the "lowerCamelCase" convention. -

      

	*RULES*

1. File (module) names should be one word and lowercased: those that need separation will be done so with a '-'.

ex) "file.txt", "file-with-bar.py",


1.5. Within the app directory, res files should be in "lowercas_underscores.xml" format, and java files should be in "UpperCamelCase.java" format,


2. Class names should be upper camel case.

ex) "ClassName",


3. Functions or variables only used within a class should begin with '_' (underscore).

ex) "_functionWithinClass()", "_variablesWithinClass",


4. Function names should be written in the "lowerCamelCase()" format,


5. Variables should be lower camel case as follows: "variableLowerCase", where the first character is lowercase,


6. Constant variables should be capitalized with underscores: "CONSTANT_VARIABLE".
